 <p><strong>History</strong></p>

   <p>
   So who were the Vikings? Vikings were warriors. They were renowned for their raw power, functional strength, and endurance that can rival even superhumans. The workout routines that you will see here are not the typical bodybuilding or powerlifting programs. They are primarily targeted to enhance the strength, speed, and functional fitness of an individual to bring out his innate warrior. This kind of training also promotes a holistic approach to fitness.

     My family has a gym membership and a personal trainer.  Recently, we were introduced to something called “The Viking”!  The routine was called “The Viking” because it began with a 1000-meter row (from the ships), a 1/2 mile run (up the beach), and then a series of exercises that were completed before “running back down the beach,” and “rowing back to the ships.”  This tickles me!  And, in my earnest geekdom I have decided to create a “historically authentic” set of the Viking exercise that combines strength, whole body, endurance, and speed training!  Yes, I’m just that silly.

     The Vikings came from the Scandinavian countries and were skilled seafarers.  Their seacraft were well-designed so that they could travel seas along coastlines and travel deeply into eastern and western Europe via rivers.  They were violent, pagan, and adept at instilling fear and taking what they wanted (i.e. raping and pillaging).  The Vikings also had impeccable timing, arriving on the European scene during the decline of the Carolingians.  Essentially, they were land-raiding pirate-merchants.  We have a number of sources for the Vikings, some detailing the horror of their attacks, others observing their cultural traits, and a few that detail their stories, religion and myths
   </p>

   <p>
     Eventually, many decided that life lived by the mercies of the sea and the winters of their homeland was too unappealing compared with settling in fertile lands amongst a cowed populace.  (Thus, the Normans founded their foothold in northern France, before Viking Rollo’s bastard grandson, William the Conqueror, spread their control to England.  William’s great grandson, Henry II, married Eleanor of Aquitane, while other family members conquerored land from the Byzantine Empire, first in Italy and then in the Levant through the First Crusade.  As settled conquerors, they were incredibly successful.)
