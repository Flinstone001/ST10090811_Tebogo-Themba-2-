<p><strong>Training Routine</strong>

  <p>
  These training routines are characterized by a high-volume approach. Now before you start anticipating the possible chances of over-training, let us tell you that proper provisions of rest and recovery are present in these workout programs. Also, while following these programs, your mental fortitude will be put to test along with your physical prowess. So get ready to go through a training routine that can bring out the warrior in you.
  </p>

  <!-- TRAINING ROUTINE -->
  <p>
  Reps, Progression and Rest Intervals
  The rep progressions of these workout routines are unique. You don’t need to complete a certain number of reps for each set, instead, complete the total number of reps that are mentioned in the tables in the given number of sets. For instance, if you are required to perform 4 sets of back squats with a rep goal of 32, you can perform first set with 10 reps,  second set with 9 reps, third set with 7 reps, and fourth set with 6 reps. If you complete the desired number of reps in the specified number of sets, you can add up the weight in the next session.

  You can add up to 5, 10, or even 20 lbs of weight depending on the lift. In case if you fail to complete the desired number of reps, you can stick to the same weight until you complete the desired number of reps with strict form.
  </p>

  <p>
  Rest Periods

  It is recommended to take 2-4 minutes of rest between the working sets of compound movements and 1-2 minutes of rest between the working sets of isolation movements.

  Now, since you have got the basic idea behind the rep progression and rest periods of this program, we can proceed with the training routines.

  If you find there are days when you just aren’t going to “make it back to the boat,” don’t worry!  There were days the Vikings didn’t either!  Sometimes they spent the winter in a warmer climate (France, Spain, Italy), and sometimes they hung around to enjoy the fat of the land at the expense of the residents:

  Just be aware that this was a gamble!  It was always possible that the king or a powerful lord or bishop would show up with an army and smack the Vikings around.  (Of course, sometimes they showed up and just paid the Vikings off!)

  For the most part, the Vikings were so devastingly effective because they arrived out of thin air with stealth and took what they wanted with speed and ferocity–put some of that in your workout!
